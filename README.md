# Testing ES6 class getters/setters on throwing errors using Jest

This project was created to figure out why jest's [spyOn method](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname-accesstype)
won't work in combination with the [toThrow matcher](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tothrowerror).

## Setup

Simply run `yarn install` to install all needed dependencies. 

Run `yarn test` or `jest` to run the tests.
